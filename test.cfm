# MarkdownParser.cfc - ColdFusion Markdown Parser

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel] (on [Google+][google-plus])

I want to try and build a Markdown parser in ColdFusion (that doesn't defer
to a Java library for the actual parsing).

Here is a lazy blockquote:

## Inspiration
   
The following libraries formed much of what I put together in my ColdFusion 
component for Markdown parsing.

* [Marked by Christopher Jeffrey][4].
* Showdown by John Fraser.
* [Parsedown by Emanuil Rusev][5].
