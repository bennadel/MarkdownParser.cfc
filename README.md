# MarkdownParser.cfc - ColdFusion Markdown Parser

by [Ben Nadel][1] (on [Google+][2])

I want to try and build a Markdown parser in ColdFusion (that doesn't defer
to a Java library for the actual parsing).

## Inspiration

The following libraries formed much of what I put together in my ColdFusion 
component for Markdown parsing.

* Showdown by John Fraser.
* [Parsedown by Emanuil Rusev][5].
